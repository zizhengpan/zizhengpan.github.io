I am a PhD student at Monash University, supervised by Professor Bohan Zhuang and Professor Jianfei Cai. Prior to that, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Adelaide and got my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology, Weihai. 

Previously, I worked on Vision-and-Language Navigation problems, these days I am more interested in Computer Vision and its related model efficiency problems.
